    <h3 class="description">Description</h3>
    <p>These stuffed bell peppers with rice are worth a try! Ninety-four percent of all stuffed peppers are made because there's leftover rice around. You can adjust this recipe in many different ways: the herbs, the meat, etc. Any ground meat works: lamb, pork, or an equal mixture of sausage and beef is fantastic. I used lean beef, but I recommend trying 1 pound beef with 1/2 pound pork sausage.</p>

    <h3 class="ingredient">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="unordered">
        <li>6 Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>3 Cups Chunky Tomato Sauce, divided</li>
        <li>½ Onion, Very Thinly Sliced</li>
        <li>1 Cup Beef Broth</li>
        <li>¼ Teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1½ Pounds Lean Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1½ Cups Cooked Rice</li>
        <li>½ Cup Freshly Shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano Chees</li>
        <li>¼ Cup Chopped Fresh Flat-Leaf Parsley</li>
        <li>4 Cloves Garlic, Minced</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>½ Teaspoons Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Chopped Fresh Flat-Leaf Parsley, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="ordered">
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Slice peppers 1/2-inch from the top; cut out stems and set aside tops. Cut core from the inside of peppers and strip away any seeds. Cut off a thin slice from the bottoms so peppers can stand upright. Poke about 4 tiny holes in the bottoms to let juices drain.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 1/2 cups tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add onion, beef broth, and red pepper flakes; spread out mixture evenly over the bottom.</li>
        <li>Set bell peppers upright in the dish.</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, cooked rice, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 2 tablespoons tomato sauce, 1/4 cup parsley, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Lightly stuff peppers with meat mixture. Spread 1 tablespoon tomato sauce on top of each portion of stuffing; place reserved tops onto peppers. Lay a piece of parchment paper loosely on top of peppers and cover the dish tightly with foil. Place the dish on top of a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until peppers have softened slightly, about 1 hour. Remove foil and parchment paper. Continue baking until meat filling is cooked through and peppers are tender, 20 to 30 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle each pepper with 1/2 teaspoon parsley and drizzle with a spoonful of pan juices.</li>
    </ol>
