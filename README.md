This project is used to show my growth while I learn web development through the Odin Project. At the start of this project I had minimal knowledge, only knowing HTML and having skills as adding and manipulating texts, adding images, adding hyperlinks, and creatings lists. My goal is to come back here at some point in the future so I can see my growth as a web developer. Other than growth this project is a website where you can access recipes to different foods - July 8th, 2024
